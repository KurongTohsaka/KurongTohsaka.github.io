## Machine Translation

Machine Translation is the task of translating a sentence $x$ from one language to a sentence $y$​ in another language.

Simple History:

- 1990s-2010s: Statistical Machine Translation
- After 2014: Neural Machine Translation



## Sequence to Sequence Model

The sequence-to-sequence model is an example of a Conditional Language Model

- Language Model because the decoder is predicting the  next word of the target sentence $y$
- Conditional because its predictions are also conditioned on the source sentence $x$

### Multi-layer RNNs in practice

High-performing RNNs are usually multi-layer.

For example: In a 2017 paper, Britz et al. find that for Neural Machine Translation, 2 to  4 layers is best for the encoder RNN, and 4 layers is best for the decoder RNN.

Transformer-based networks (e.g., BERT) are usually deeper, like 12 or 24 layers.

### Greedy decoding

We saw how to generate (or “decode”) the target sentence by taking argmax on each  step of the decoder. This is **greedy decoding** (take most probable word on each step)

But this way has some problems. Like this:

### Exhaustive search decoding

Ideally, we want to find a (length T) translation y that maximizes

We could try computing all possible sequences $y$​

- This means that on each step t of the decoder, we’re tracking $V^t$ possible partial  translations, where $V$​ is vocab size
- This $O(V^T)$​ complexity is far too expensive!

### Beam search decoding

Core idea: On each step of decoder, keep track of the $k$ most probable partial  translations (which we call hypotheses)

- $k$  is the beam size (in practice around 5 to 10)

Beam search is not guaranteed to find optimal solution, but much more efficient than exhaustive search.

In greedy decoding, usually we decode until the model produces an  “\<END\>”  token.

In beam search decoding, different hypotheses may produce \<END\> tokens on different timesteps.

We have our list of completed hypotheses.

Problem with this: longer hypotheses have lower scores.
