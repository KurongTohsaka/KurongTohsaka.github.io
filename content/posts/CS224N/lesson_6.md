## Training an RNN Language Model

- Get a **big corpus of text** which is a sequence of words $x^{(1)},...,x^{(T)}$
- Feed into RNN-LM; compute output distribution  $\hat y ^{(t)}$ **for every timestep $t$​**

### Why is vanishing gradient a problem?

> - 来自远处的梯度信号会丢失，因为它比来自近处的梯度信号小得多
> - 因此，模型权重只会根据近期效应而不是长期效应进行更新

If gradient is small, the model can’t learn this dependency. So, the model is unable to predict similar long distance dependencies at test time.

### Why is exploding gradient a problem?

- This can cause bad updates: we take too large a step and reach a weird and bad  parameter configuration (with large loss)
- In the worst case, this will result in Inf or NaN in your network (then you have to restart training from an earlier checkpoint)

### Gradient clipping: solution for exploding gradient

- Gradient clipping 梯度裁剪: if the norm of the gradient is greater than some threshold, scale it  down before applying SGD update
- Intuition: take a step in the same direction, but a smaller step



## Long Short-Term Memory RNNs

On step $t$ , there is a **hidden state**  $h^{(t)}$ and a **cell state** $c^{(t)}$​

- Both are vectors length $n$
- The cell stores **long-term information**
- The LSTM can **read, erase, and write** information from the cell

The selection of which information is erased/written/read is controlled by three corresponding **gates**

- The gates are also vectors length $n$
- On each timestep, each element of the gates can be $open (1), closed (0)$, or somewhere in-between
- The gates are dynamic: their value is computed based on the current context

### How does LSTM solve vanishing gradients?

- The LSTM architecture makes it easier for the RNN to  preserve information over many timesteps.

- LSTM doesn’t guarantee that there is no vanishing/exploding  gradient, but it does provide an easier way for the model to learn  long-distance dependencies
