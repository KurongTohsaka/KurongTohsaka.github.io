## Meaning 

Definition: **meaning 语义**

- the idea that is represented by a word, phrase, etc. 
- the idea that a person wants to express by using words, signs, etc. 
- the idea that is expressed in a work of writing, art, etc.



## WordNet

Common NLP solution: Use, e.g., **WordNet**, a thesaurus containing  lists of synonym (同义词) sets and hypernyms (上位词) (“is a” relationships). 

### Problems with resources like WordNet

- Great as a resource but missing nuance

- Missing new meanings of words

- Subjective

- Requires human labor to create and adapt

- Can’t compute accurate word similarity

  - Representing words as discrete symbols

## Word Vectors

**Distributional semantics 分布式语义:** A word’s meaning is given by the words that frequently appear close-by.

- When a word $w$​ appears in a text, its **context 上下文** is the set of words  that appear nearby (within a fixed-size window).
- Use the many contexts of $w$ to build up a representation of $w$

word vectors are also called **word embeddings 词嵌入** or (neural) word representations.

### Word2vec

**Word2vec** (Mikolov et al. 2013) is a framework for learning word vectors.

- Every word in a fixed vocabulary is represented by a vector
- Go through each position $t$ in the text, which has a center word $c$ and context  (“outside”) words $o$​
- Use the **similarity of the word vectors** for $c$ and o to **calculate the probability** of $o$ given  $c$
- **Keep adjusting the word vectors** to maximize this probability

For Word2vec, its objective function $J(\theta)$ is the negative log likelihood:
$$
J(\theta)=-\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{t=1}\sum_{\substack{-m \le j \le m \\ j\neq0}}logP(w_{t+j} \ | \ w_t; \ \theta)
$$
As the function, maximizing predictive accuracy transfers to minimizing objective function.

We use $v_w$ when $w$ is a center word and $u_w$ when $w$ is a context word. We will use two vectors, a center word $c$ and a context word $o$ :
$$
P(o|c) = \frac{exp(u^T_ov_c)}{\sum_{w \in V}exp(u^T_wv_c)}
$$
The equation above has some points:

- This is an example of the **softmax function: ** 
  $$
  softmax(x_i)=\frac{exp(x_i)}{\sum^n_{j=1}exp(x_j)}=p_i
  $$
  
- The softmax function maps arbitrary values $x_i$ :  to a **probability distribution** $p_i$​

  - “max” because amplifies probability of largest $x_i$ ;
  - “soft” because still assigns some probability to smaller $x_i$ 

### variants

Two model variants:

1. Skip-grams: 

   Predict context (“outside”) words (position independent) given center word

2. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW): 

   Predict center word from (bag of) context words
